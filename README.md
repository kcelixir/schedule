[Texas](https://gitlab.com/dgmcguire/texas), [Drab](https://github.com/grych/drab) and Phoenix LiveView are libraries that allow developers to create webapps with similar user experiences to those found in JavaScript-heavy applications, while remaining (mostly) in the relative comfort of a server-side rendered world. We'll take a look at the current state of these libraries and some examples.
